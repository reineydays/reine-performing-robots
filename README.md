Huang Yi and his robot arm Kuka perform a perfectly timed theatrical dance. The performance is so perfectly timed that it serves as a perfect example for the playground discussion that theater offers for sharpening the precision of robots and their coordination from the Hoffman article discussing robots as performers. The robot takes on a character and is just as valuable as Yi during the performance - both move with each other seamlessely. I used to consider how we as humans are striving to make robots faster, but in this case, theater emphasizes that robots cannot be too fast either; rather, they must to some degree resemble humans while taking advantage of their extra capabilities of a robot. They must empathize with humans to integrate into the performance. But Kuka, for example, also employs a green lazer at times for Yi to dance around. The arm additionally is not designed to appear as anything other than a robotic arm. The robot's movements are, from David V. Lu's Ontology of Robot Theater, human-produced and open-looped - hard coded, organized, and specified prior to the dance. Yet though the robot does not create movements through algorithms (thus changing the performance), his job, in this performance, becomes less about the robot's independance, and more about timing, stylization, and how Yi can create fluidity with otherwise structured robotic arm movements.
