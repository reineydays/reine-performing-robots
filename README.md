# reine-performing-robots

DUE FOR NOVEMBER 16TH, THURSDAY:

- Begin illustrator files and finalize measurements for layer 2 of spinning robot arm 
- Meet with Arantza and finalize construction details, collaborate to make sure Software projections are in sync with hardware
- Finalize specific dimension intensions for robot project

- Be ready to start laser cutting in class on Thursday.

TO BE PRINTED:

- central Vinyl acryllic base
- two acryllic stands to hold both motors
- two acryllic CD bases for the two motor spins

- Gather the two light motors needed for the second arm.


DUE FOR NOVEMBER 21ST, TUESDAY:

- Finish second layer of robot arm and have started construction of initial layer (the heavier duty motor).
- Second layer should be robust and durable for application on to initial layer.


DUE FOR NOVEMBER 23RD, THURSDAY:

- Finish robot arm and be ready for trial runs for durability and management. Begin preparations for acrylic wall to go in front of arm.

Robotic Performance: Huang Yi and Kuka

Huang Yi and his robot arm Kuka perform a perfectly timed theatrical dance. The performance is so precisely timed that it serves as a beautiful example for Hoffman's discussion that theater is a playground for learning how to sharpen the precision of robots and their coordination as performers. The robot takes on a character and is just as valuable as Yi during the performance - both move with each other seamlessely. I used to consider how we as humans are striving to make robots faster, but in this case, theater emphasizes that robots cannot be too fast either; rather, they must to some degree resemble humans while taking advantage of their extra capabilities of a robot. They must empathize with humans to integrate into the performance. But Kuka, for example, also employs a green lazer at times for Yi to dance around. The arm additionally is not designed to appear as anything other than a robotic arm. The robot's movements are, from David V. Lu's Ontology of Robot Theater, human-produced and open-looped - hard coded, organized, and specified prior to the dance. Yet though the robot does not create movements through algorithms (thus changing the performance), his job, in this performance, becomes less about the robot's independance, and more about timing, stylization, and how Yi can create fluidity with otherwise structured robotic arm movements.
